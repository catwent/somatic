        this is a somatic poetry machine. use your body to write poems by moving this site around space and place. it works best in new haven, connecticut in the area of 1156 chapel street, since many poems can only be written in specific locales. but, you can write many poems by walking, by running, by reaching your arms up, left, and right, and by bending upside down.
